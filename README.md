Amazon Sales Data – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world Amazon sales dataset to uncover insights related to customer behavior, pricing strategies, product popularity, and sentiment trends.

Using Python and data analysis libraries, I cleaned the data, handled missing and inconsistent values, and analyzed relationships between product ratings, review counts, discounts, and prices.

 Key Insights:

Most product categories have average ratings above 3.5, indicating generally positive customer feedback.

Certain categories show lower average ratings, highlighting potential improvement areas.

Products with higher review counts tend to be more popular and may represent top-selling items.

Discount strategies vary widely across categories, with some offering very high discounts (up to ~78%), while others follow stable pricing.

A weak positive correlation exists between discounted price and rating.

Keyword analysis shows strong demand for smart devices, charging cables, USB connectivity, and fast charging features.

Sentiment analysis of customer reviews reveals mostly neutral to slightly negative feedback, with recurring issues around battery, charging, and usability.
